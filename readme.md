This tool resets your Windows Network Stack entirely, without needing a reboot or any reconfiguration.

You *don't* have to reboot your computer, router, or modem.
Just run the batch, and voila.

# Steps:

1. Run 'reset.bat' every time your download stops or hits a very slow speed.

1a. Run 'reset_silent.bat' if you don't want to be bothered with a Y/N option and/or are automating the process.

# Disclaimer: **If your internet stops working after excecuting the batch files, go ahead and run 'undo.bat'.**
