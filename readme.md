This resets your windows Network Stack entirely, without needing a reboot.

Run 'reset.bat' every time your download stops or hits a very slow speed.

Run 'reset_silent.bat' if you don't want to be bothered with a Y/N option or are automating.

You *don't* have to reboot your computer, router or modem.
Just run the batch, and voila.

**If your internet stops working after running this, please run 'undo.bat'.**
